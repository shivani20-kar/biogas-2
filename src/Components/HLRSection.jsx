          The High-Load Reactor (HLR) is the most efficient biogas technology
          for processing Napier grass. It is three times smaller and more
          cost-effective than conventional CSTR systems. For a 10 TPD Bio-CNG
          plant, a single 4,000 m³ HLR reactor is sufficient. In addition to
          being compact, the HLR is more reliable and consumes less electricity
          for internal operations. GD Biogas has implemented the world’s largest
          HLR-based project, generating 26 MW of power (equivalent to 110 TPD of
          Bio-CNG) using sorghum and maize. The same advanced technology is
          equally effective for Napier grass and sugarcane.
