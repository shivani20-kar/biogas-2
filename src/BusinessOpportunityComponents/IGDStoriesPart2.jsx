        Now Girish is ready to work to realize his dream of empowering farmers
        and villagers with economic independence. And then to his vision of
        Social Salvation- healthy life style, clean and hygienic Living
        standards, nutritive and variety of food and ultimately social cohesion.
        Let’s look at the Challenges State of Maharashtra, India has a
        population of 126 million people. Out of which 52% is rural population.
        17.35% of the population is poor. Land Area is 307,713 Square
        Kilometers. Agriculture land is 54.4%. Income of farmers is USD 4.00 per
        day. Even after 75 Years of Independence, farmers are still poor. Even
        hope has died that some betterment will happen. Newspapers are inundated
        with the stories, how farmers are totally dependent on rain. No rain
        mean, cycle of poverty. Someone has to take the initiative to change the
        plight of Maharashtra’s farmers. Initiative will herald in other states
        of India. Girish wants to take the lead in his district of Satara in
        Maharashtra and is ready to contribute whatever he has for the
        betterment of farmers, so his children do not miss what he missed in his
        childhood. That's Girish commitment to his ancestors that he would avail
        all his resources – financial and intellectual, to usher in a new
        revolution. Revolution where farmers will become commercially astute,
        economically empowered, socially enlightened, and globally exposed for a
        better tomorrow where there is smile everywhere. It’s a structured
        program, where every resource is fully used. Land will be used for
        commercially stable agriculture which is not affected by vagaries of
        weather. Human resources for Dairy Farming, Environment for
        international tourism. So, every resource is utilized for economic and
        social upliftment.
